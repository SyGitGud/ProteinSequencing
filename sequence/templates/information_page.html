		<h2>About the Product</h2>
		<p>
			The product is developed by the members of Team 5 for COMP 496: Senior Project II. This product 
			uses an AI, transformer model for protein scaffolding.
		</p>
		<h3>Vision</h3>
		<p>
			The product's vision is to create an informative introduction to working with models that predict 
			complete protein scaffolds from incomplete protein scaffolds by using a clean and detailed 
			interface.
		</p>
		<h2>What does the model do?</h2>
		<p>The model contextualizes patterns in training datasets.</p>
		<h2>How does the model work?</h2>
		<p>
			The model uses the k-nearest neighbor (KNN) algorithm to take an incomplete scaffold, fill in the 
			scaffold gaps, and output the complete scaffold and training data.
		</p>
		<h2>What is the purpose of the model?</h2>
		<p>
			The purpose of the model is to predict and complete protein sequences that are only partially 
			known to researchers.
		</p>
		<h2>How to use this product?</h2>
		<ol>
			<li>Select a scaffold from the dropdown menu.</li>
			<li>Enter the incomplete scaffold in the textbox.</li>
			<li>Press the enter key.</li>
			<li>
				The complete scaffold, output accuracy, and training sequence will be displayed to the 
				corresponding textfield.
			</li>

		<h2>What are protein scaffolds?</h2>
		<p>Protein scaffolds are molecules of protein that binds to other protein.</p>
		<h2>Which database is used for the product?</h2>
		<p>The database used for the product is MySQL.</p>
